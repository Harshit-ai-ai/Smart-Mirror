This project is a Smart Mirror built using a Raspberry Pi that displays contextual information such as time and weather through a minimalist interface and a reactive avatar. The system is designed to function as both a practical daily-use device and an exploration of how humans perceive and interact with adaptive digital representations.
The mirror runs a lightweight web server locally on the Raspberry Pi, rendering a full-screen interface on an HDMI display mounted behind a two-way mirror. Real-time weather data is fetched using an external API based on a user-configured location, while the avatar dynamically adapts its appearance according to the environmental context.
Beyond functionality, the project draws inspiration from the philosophical concept of Superimposition (Adhyāsa)—the tendency to project identity and awareness onto external forms. By presenting a responsive yet non-conscious avatar, the mirror demonstrates how easily perception can attribute intelligence and presence to purely mechanical systems.
The system is fully self-contained, Linux-compatible, and designed to be buildable within a short timeframe, making it suitable for hackathons, rapid prototyping, and educational demonstrations.
